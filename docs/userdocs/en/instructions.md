# Instructions

This software was developed to insert an image in several MS Word files. To achieve this objective, you should follow the next steps:

1. Select the type of input path to use: a list of files or a folder path. 

2. Click on *Explore* in *Files/folder Path* row to select a valid MS Word file or a valid folder.

3. Click on *Explore* in *Picture Path* row to select a valid image file to insert in the documents selected before. When the file is selected via the file explorer, an image preview is shown in the Preview Box. It also loads the dimensions measured in the selected unit, shown in the *Units* row.

4. You can modify the size of the image to insert and if *Keep aspect ratio* is checked, the other dimension is modified accordingly.

5. You can also modify the offset from left (*LeftOffset*) and bottom (*BottomOffset*). You can also enter negative numbers to get an offset to the right and to the bottom. 

6. Once all the dimensions are set, you can enter the placeholder, which is a portion of text in the document which works as a reference.

7. In save options, you could select if you one to save the PDF in the same folder where it is the MS Word document or a subfolder and enter the name. If the folder doesn’t exist, the software will create it for you.

8. Finally, you can click on *Generate* to process the documents and insert the image with the entered dimensions in the reference entered.

Then, you can check the result opening the PDF. Don’t forget to close the PDF, if you want to regenerate it, otherwise an error will occur as the software cannot write the file if it is open.
