# Insert image in document

This project results from the necesity to insert an image in various MS Word / PDF documents 
and export them to PDF files.

## Motivation

The software was developed in base of a requirement of my mother who is a teacher and director in charge of her institution
and required to insert a signature image in a set of MS Word and PDF Documents at a specific place. Then, as the task may be time consuming,
(or requires special tools when the document format input is PDF)
I developed this software to facilitate the image insertion and creation of PDF files based on the modified documents.

This application is intended to manipulate either the Word documents or the PDF documents via a script, providing a graphical interface to
enter the paths to the documents and the image. It also allows to specify the dimensions and the placeholder where
the image will be inserted and options to save the generated PDF files.

## Features

This software has the following features:

1. Choose between Word documents or PDF documents as input format.

2. Specify either the list of MS Word/PDF documents or a folder which contains them.

3. A preview of the selected image and options to scale the dimentions keeping the aspect ratio, as well as 
  offsets with respect to the placeholder, in different measurement units.

4. Specify the placeholder which is a text where the image will be inserted.

5. Specify the specific page and absolute reference in the page, if desired, for the image insertion (only for PDF).

6. Options to save the generated PDF file either in the same folder as the original document (only for Word) or a subfolder for 
  all the generated files.

7. Save the current options employed to generate the document accross sessions, and restore
 them to the default values.

8. Complete interface in two languages: english and spanish.

9. Help information with steps to work with the software.
